## Technical Implementation

### Files Updated

1. **`src/etl/ingest_local_venues.py`** - Static HTML venue scrapers

   - 23 venues configured with proper categories and selectors
   - Comprehensive event scraping and processing pipeline
   - Quality checks and data validation

2. **`src/etl/ingest_dynamic_venues.py`** - Dynamic JavaScript venue scrapers
   - 6 venues configured with Selenium-based scraping
   - Advanced scrolling and content loading handling
   - Caching and quality control mechanisms

### Category Mapping

User categories have been properly mapped to database categories:

- `Major Venue` â†’ `major_venue`
- `Entertainment District` â†’ `entertainment_district`
- `Shopping & Cultural` â†’ `shopping_cultural`
- `Museum` â†’ `museum`
- `Theater` â†’ `theater`
- `Festival & City` â†’ `festival_city`
- `Aggregator` â†’ `aggregator`
- `Nightlife` â†’ `nightlife`

### Quality Assurance Features

- **Data Validation**: All venues undergo comprehensive validation
