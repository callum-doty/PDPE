## 🔄 Architecture Transformation

### **Before (Scattered Data Approach)**

```
venues → separate query
events → separate query
weather → separate query
psychographic_layers → separate query
→ combine in visualization
```

### **After (Venue-Centric Approach)**

```
venues → enrich with ALL contextual data
  ├── associated events
  ├── local weather conditions
  ├── demographic context
  ├── psychographic scores
  ├── ML predictions with venue context
  └── environmental factors
→ venue-focused visualization
```
